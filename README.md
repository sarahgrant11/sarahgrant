For this project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be usful for someone who i new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some informations about the hidtory and rules of the game. This is the underling model building something with those capabilities. I was able to get the model to preict hte sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user o the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencis and solid results.
